# kyverno-aws-adapter

## Description
Kyverno AWS Adapter is a Kubernetes controller for the `AWSConfig` CRD. As of now, it observes the realtime state of an EKS cluster an reconciles it with the current state, but can be further expanded to other AWS services later on by extending the current API with the help of [AWS SDK for Go v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2).

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need an [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) cluster to run against.

### Running on the EKS cluster
1. Make sure that you have configured an [IAM role for the service account](#IAM-Role-for-Service-Account) `kyverno-aws-adapter-sa` in your desired namespace (configured in `values.yaml`) and specified the role's ARN in the `roleArn` field inside `values.yaml` file.
2. Install the Helm chart after making any necessary changes to `config/helm/kyverno-aws-adapter/values.yaml`	
   ```sh
   helm install kyverno-aws-adapter config/helm/kyverno-aws-adapter
   ```
3. Check the `status` field of the `<cluster-name>-config` custom resource in the namespace specified in `values.yaml`. For instance, if the cluster name is `eks-test` and namespace is `nirmata`, then:
   ```sh
   kubectl get awsconfig eks-test-config -n nirmata -o yaml 
   ```

## Modifying Source Code

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

## Helm Values
Currently supported values for the Helm chart are as follows:
| Value | Description |
-- | ---
| `namespace` | Namespace for installing the controller and CRD |
| `eksCluster` | Configuration for EKS cluster's `name` and `region` |
| `registryConfig` | ghcr.io username and password configuration for the image secret |
| `pollInterval` | Interval for controller reconciliation |
| `image` | Configuration for image `name`, `tag` and `pullPolicy` |
| `roleArn` | IAM Role ARN with required permissions for the EKS cluster |
| `nameOverride` | Override the chart name |
| `fullnameOverride` | Override the entire generated name |


## IAM Role for Service Account
This adapter utilizes the ARN of a user-defined IAM Role associated with any policy that has `Full: List, Read` permissions for the EKS service, including the following:

| Permission |
| --- |
| ListAddons |
| ListClusters |
| ListFargateProfiles |
| ListIdentityProviderConfigs |
| ListNodeGroups |
| ListUpdates |
| AccessKubernetesApi |
| DescribeAddon |
| DescribeAddonVersions |
| DescribeCluster |
| DescribeFargateProfile |
| DescribeIdentityProviderConfig |
| DescribeNodegroup |
| DescribeUpdate |
| ListTagsForResource |

You can specify the Role's ARN in the `roleArn` field inside the Helm chart's `values.yaml` file.

Please ensure that the trust relationship policy for your IAM role resembles the following format:
```json
{
  "Version": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::$account_id:oidc-provider/$oidc_provider"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "$oidc_provider:aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
          "$oidc_provider:sub": "system:serviceaccount:$namespace:$service_account"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
